🔹 1. Scale of Simulation
- Agents: 100 → Good, small-to-medium call center size. For 24/7, that’s ~4–6 agents per shift if spread thin, or more if you overlap coverage.
- Customers: IDs up to 20 million → Fine. Gives you a big pool so you don’t repeat IDs too often.
Ops: 24/7, 30-min intervals → Standard. One month = ~1440 intervals.
- Base volume: 100 calls per interval
    - 48 intervals/day × 30 days × 100 calls = 144,000 base calls per month
    - With modifier() scaling, this could be more/less.
    - For 100 agents, this works out to ~1,400 calls/agent/month, or ~45 calls/day. That’s realistic.

✅ Overall scale is good.

🔹 2. Wait Time & Abandons

```python
wait_time = generate_time([(0.7, (0, 120)), (0.3, (120, 300))], skip=False)
abandoned = wait_time > 120
```

This gives ~30% abandoned → too high for normal ops.

Most real centers target 5–15% abandons, with 20–30% only in stress conditions.

👉 Suggestion: 
`[(0.85, (0, 120)), (0.15, (120, 300))] = ~15% abandon rate.`

🔹 3. Handle Time
`[(0.1, (60, 300)), (0.7, (60, 1200)), (0.2, (1200, 3600))]`

- 10% quick calls (1–5 min)
- 70% normal calls (1–20 min)
- 20% long calls (20–60 min)

📌 Realistic Average Handle Time (AHT) is usually 4–10 minutes in many industries.

Your distribution skews too long (because 20% of calls > 20 minutes is rare).

👉 Suggestion:
`[(0.1, (60, 180)), (0.75, (180, 900)), (0.15, (900, 1800))]`

- Quick: 1–3 min
- Normal: 3–15 min
- Long: 15–30 min (rare)

This brings AHT closer to 6–8 min average.

🔹 4. Resolution & FCR
```python
resolved = not abandoned and random.random() < 0.8
fcr = not abandoned and random.random() < 0.6
```

Resolution rate 80% → 👍 realistic.

First Call Resolution (FCR) 60% → also realistic (most centers ~60–75%).

✅ Keep as is.

🔹 5. CSAT
```python
csat_score = random.randint(1, 5) if not abandoned and random.random() > 0.15 else None
```

So 85% of answered calls get a survey.

Distribution is uniform (1–5 equally likely).

In reality, CSAT skews positively (most 4s and 5s, few 1s).

👉 Suggestion: use weighted distribution:
           
```python
csat_score = random.choices([1,2,3,4,5], weights=[0.05,0.1,0.15,0.3,0.4])[0] \
             if not abandoned and random.random() > 0.15 else None
```

= More 4s and 5s, fewer 1s.

🔹 6. Sentiment
sentiment = random.choice(SENTIMENTS) if not abandoned else ""


If SENTIMENTS = ["positive","neutral","negative"], equal probability means too many negatives.

Real distribution is ~60–70% positive, 20–30% neutral, 5–10% negative.

👉 Use weighted random instead of flat choice.

🔹 7. Agent Assignment
agent_id = random.randint(105530, 105630) if not abandoned else None


That’s 100 agents, good.

But you’re assigning uniformly random.

In reality, distribution depends on shifts — some agents aren’t working at that interval.

👉 If you want realism: generate shifts and only pick from on-duty agents per interval.

✅ Summary of Adjustments

- Abandon rate: reduce from ~30% → ~10–15%.
- Handle time: shorten distribution → avg ~6–8 mins.
- CSAT: skew toward 4–5.
- Sentiment: skew toward positive.
- Agent assignment: link to shifts for realism.
