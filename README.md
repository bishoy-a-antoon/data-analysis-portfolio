## üöÄ Projects

- [**RTA Call Center Analytics (WIP)**](rta_call_center_analytics)  
  Work-in-progress project analyzing one month of simulated call center data (190,000+ calls). Calls are studied across days and intervals, modeled to reflect realistic SLA-driven performance metrics. Functions and variables have been carefully refined to align with industry standards.  
  **Current stage:** exploratory analysis and feature engineering.  
  **Planned steps:** interactive dashboard that allows tweaking simulation parameters to observe effects on performance metrics.

- [**Call Center Sentiment Analysis**](call_center_kaggle_dataset)  
  Sentiment analysis on a Kaggle dataset of 32,000+ call records (2020). Includes text preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and insights into customer experience trends.

- [**Call Center Metrics Analysis**](call_center_simulated_dataset)  
  Analysis of a synthetic call center dataset generated using `generate_dataset.py`. Focuses on key performance metrics such as service levels, handle time, and agent utilization.

- [**Motorcycle Parts Sales Analysis**](motorcycle_parts_sales_analysis)  
  Exploratory analysis of motorcycle parts sales data, highlighting seasonal patterns, demand drivers, and revenue insights.

- [**Telco Customer Churn (WIP)**](telco_customer_churn)  
  Work-in-progress project examining customer churn in a telecom dataset.  
  **Current stage:** data preprocessing.  
  **Planned steps:** exploratory analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and dashboard development.
